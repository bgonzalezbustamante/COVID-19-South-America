<small>Note: The estimations have been calculated with a parametric serial interval based on a Gamma distribution with mean μ = 7.5 and standard deviation σ = 3.4 following to [Li *et al.* (2020)](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001316). The epicurve shows new infections over the period. On the other hand, estimated R illustrates the number of infections that a single case generates: when the value is lower than one the outbreak is under control. Finally, the explored serial interval distribution shows the time between symptoms in a case and their infector. It is relevant to note that these estimations are too early in this epidemic to obtain a reliable posterior coefficient of variation of the R indicator.</small>
