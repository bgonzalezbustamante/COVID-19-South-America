The countries reviewed are as follows: Argentina (ARG), Bolivia (BOL), Brazil (BRA), Chile (CHL), Colombia (COL), Ecuador (ECU), Paraguay (PRY), Peru (PER), Uruguay (URY), and Venezuela (VEN). Furthermore, the United Kingdom (GBR), Spain (ESP), and Italy (ITA) are computed for comparative purposes.

We gather data from the following sources of public information: National Health Service of the United Kingdom, Ministerio de Sanidad of Spain, Dipartimento della Protezione Civile of Italy, Ministerio de Salud of Argentina, Ministerio de Salud del Estado Plurinacional of Bolivia, Ministério da Saúde of Brazil, Ministerio de Salud of Chile, Ministerio de Salud Pública y Protección Social of Colombia, Ministerio de Salud Pública of Ecuador, Ministerio de Salud Pública y Bienestar Social of Paraguay, Ministerio de Salud of Peru, Ministerio de Salud Pública of Uruguay, and Ministerio del Poder Popular para la Salud of Venezuela.
