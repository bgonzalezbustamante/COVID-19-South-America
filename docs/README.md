This is a measurement of COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak -a pandemic- in South America, specifically, the epidemic curve based on the incidence in the region (*i.e.* epicurve stratified by country, [see figure](Incidence-South-America.md)), as well as the estimated R and the explored serial interval (SI) distribution by case.<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> The countries reviewed are as follows: [Argentina](Rho-Argentina.md) (ARG), [Bolivia](Rho-Bolivia.md) (BOL), [Brazil](Rho-Brazil.md) (BRA), [Chile](Rho-Chile.md) (CHL), [Colombia](Rho-Colombia.md) (COL), [Ecuador](Rho-Ecuador.md) (ECU), [Paraguay](Rho-Paraguay.md) (PRY), [Peru](Rho-Peru.md) (PER), Uruguay (URY), and Venezuela (VEN).<sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>

Moreover, [Spain](Rho-Spain.md) (ESP), the [United Kingdom](Rho-United-Kingdom.md) (GBR), and [Italy](Rho-Italy.md) (ITA) are computed for comparative purposes ([see epicurve stratified by country](Incidence-Europe.md)).<sup id="a3">[3](#f3)</sup>

The charts and estimations are updated after the close of the day in Greenwich Mean Time. The materials can be downloaded from the **OSF-Project** (DOI: [10.17605/OSF.IO/6FM7X](http://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/6FM7X)). This site will be updated on a regular basis, see the [changelog](https://github.com/bgonzalezbustamante/COVID-19-South-America/blob/master/changelog.txt).

### Notes

1.  <small id="f1"> R is specifically the effective reproduction number (R<sub>e</sub>), which is calculated on a daily incidence basis. Therefore, it allows us to measure the public health systems response (see [Cori *et al*., 2013](https://dx.doi.org/10.1093%2Faje%2Fkwt133); see also [Thomson *et al.*, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2019.100356)). On the other hand, SI is the time interval between the symptoms in each case and the onset of them in secondary cases because of transmission.</small> [↩](#a1)

3. <small id="f3"> I have gathered data from the following sources of public information: National Health Service of the United Kingdom, Ministerio de Sanidad of Spain, Dipartimento della Protezione Civile of Italy, Ministerio de Salud of Argentina, Ministerio de Salud del Estado Plurinacional of Bolivia, Ministério da Saúde of Brazil, Ministerio de Salud of Chile, Ministerio de Salud Pública y Protección Social of Colombia, Ministerio de Salud Pública of Ecuador, Ministerio de Salud Pública y Bienestar Social of Paraguay, Ministerio de Salud of Peru, Ministerio de Salud Pública of Uruguay, and Ministerio del Poder Popular para la Salud of Venezuela.</small> [↩](#a3)
