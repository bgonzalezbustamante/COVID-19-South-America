<small>Note: The estimations have been calculated with a parametric serial interval based on a Gamma distribution with mean μ = 7.5 and standard deviation σ = 3.4 following to [Li *et al.* (2020)](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001316). The epicurve shows new infections over the period. On the other hand, estimated R illustrates the number of infections that a single case generates: when the value is lower than one, the outbreak is under control ([see figure in detail](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bgonzalezbustamante/COVID-19-South-America/master/docs/images/20200314/20200314_Re_CHL.png)). R is specifically the effective reproduction number (R<sub>e</sub>), which is calculated on a daily incidence basis. Therefore, it allows us to measure the public health systems response (see [Cori *et al*., 2013](https://dx.doi.org/10.1093%2Faje%2Fkwt133); see also [Thomson *et al.*, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2019.100356)). Finally, the explored serial interval (SI) distribution shows the time interval between the symptoms in each case and the onset of them in secondary cases because of transmission. It is relevant to note that these estimations are too early in this epidemic to obtain a reliable posterior coefficient of variation of the R indicator.</small>
