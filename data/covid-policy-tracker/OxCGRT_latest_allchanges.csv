The document says that contact tracing happens for those who test positive or show symptoms upon arriving to mentioned airports and border points. What if someone tests positive in other locations? How is contact tracing done for them?   3) When was the first day that testing became available in Afghanistan? When it did, was it available for everyone? Or was there a criteria for who could get tested? What is the criteria (generally available or available to only those who show symptoms) for testing now?    Can you please respond to each questions? If you don't have answers, please let me know and I will try to reach out to others.     Thanks so much!""

There has been a form, SoP, and guidelines developed for the purpose, I am copying Momena Jan (the national focal point of contact tracing) for more info if needed.   The testing was available in early February and it was based on the case definition of that time (only people coming from China in points of entries having sign and symptoms of the disease were tested) then when Iran was also confirmed as a country with transmission potentials, the passengers from Iran was also screened and if they had sign and symptoms they were also being tested.

Central African Republic,CAF,20200416,H3: Contact tracing,1,,"16 April 2020  The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Central African Republic (CAR) increased sharply in the reporting period, jumping from 12 on 15 April to 64 on 30 April, with still no casualties reported. Imported cases, mostly from Cameroon, CAR’s main trading partner, make up 75% of the total (48 out of 64). The CAR authorities have therefore stepped up efforts to control the flow of travellers coming from Cameroon, increasing sanitary controls at the main border crossings and along the main road to the capital Bangui. On 27 April, the Interior and Transport Ministers issued a joint decree suspending traffic between four main Cameroon border crossing towns (Ngaoundaye, Garoua- a-Boulai, Gamboula and Yantchi) and Bangui for a duration of 1 month. Exceptions apply for commercial trucks, as well as official, and UN and humanitarian NGO vehicles. All active confirmed cases are currently located in the capital Bangui. However, with the current acceleration of both importation and local transmission, the risk that the epidemic will eventually reach the interior of the country is increasing.   https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/UNICEF%20Central%20African%20Republic%20Humanitarian%20Situation%20Report%20COVID-19%20No.%202%20-16-30%20April%202020.pdf    17 April 2020  The MINUSCA Rwanda Contingent has donated a COVID-19 screening device to the Central African Republic (CAR).

The measures include:    - Effective April 1, 2020 the NHT will reduce interest rates on all new loans by 1% (benefitting some 8,000 new mortgagors annually)  - All existing NHT loans will be reduced by 0.5% (benefitting some100,000 existing mortgagors).  Interest rate discounts currently offered to special groups, such as mortgagors aged 55 years and over, the disabled as well as public sector workers will continue.  - The interest rate discounts for the disabled will be effective April 1, 2020 and will also be extended to include the parents of disabled children.  - The NHT will expand the Intergenerational Mortgage Program. Beginning April 1, 2020, the NHT will extend this benefit for eligible applicants for other loan products, such as open market purchases and construction loans. Funding under this Program will be capped at the prevailing loan limit.  - The NHT will also provide greater benefits to contributors over 65 years. Persons in this category will be designated as Voluntary Contributors and therefore be able to access housing benefits with tenures extending up to age 70.  - The NHT will establish a special arrangement whereby, following maturity of the loan, the insurance arrangement at special rates may be continued. The cost savings will enable beneficiaries to continue the protection of their properties in a period of life when their earning power may be at its lowest.  - The NHT will, during FY2020/21, seek to leverage its current mortgage loan portfolio through a securitization transaction to generate additional inflows.    Covid Student’s Loan Bureau  Jamaica will be deferring principal and interest payments on student loans for the three-month period April – June to cushion the impact on young graduates while giving new graduates 14 months to start payment their student loans after graduation. The Constituency Development Fund will also be increased by $3 million to address Covid Compassionate Grants and Care packages for the vulnerable on a constituency basis. This will cost approximately $200 million.    https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2020/04/jamaica-government-and-institution-measures-in-response-to-covid.html"

When such businesses file and pay their payroll returns as usual on the 15th of April, May and June, for each employee, with taxable income that is less than 1.5 on whose behalf statutory returns are applied, the Government will transfer funds at a rate of $9,000 per fortnight to that tourism related business, by direct transfer to their bank account, paid monthly. For the months of April, May and June that will equate to $54,000 for each employee they retain whose taxable income is less than $1.5 million    Informal sector - The Government will allocate $1 billion in additional funding to the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to provide Covid Grants to those who are marginally self-employed and informally employed.    The application portal for CARE opened on 9th April, 2020.     Minimum wage in Jamaica is $7000 per week i.e. $28000 p.m. Under this package, the maximum allocation over three months (April, May, June) is $57,000 i.e. $18,000 p.m. Hence, this will be less than 50% of lost income for many workers.    https://jis.gov.jm/media/2020/04/CARE-Brochure-Ministry-of-Finance-2020.pdf  https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2020/04/jamaica-government-and-institution-measures-in-response-to-covid.html"

In this context, the production and export of oil has almost come to a stop since January 18, 2020, due to the closure of oil ports and terminals. Assuming the disruption stays for up to end April 2020, and oil production resumes slowly to reach last-year’s average production level by the end of the year, Libya would only produce a daily average of 0.67 million bpd this year (about half of last year’s).

A necessary action to keep the flow of movement limited over a holiday that holds significance in the country. Prior to the ban, traffic into Ulaanbaatar was monitored by stopping cars and requiring that all passengers have their foreheads scanned to detect an abnormal temperature. Something I myself experienced.  But not all public transportation was banned, within the capital the main bus lines were running, but were limited to running on “peak” hours. And even though in the U.S. the CDC advises that wearing a face mask isn’t necessary if you are not sick, they were mandatory while riding public transportation in Ulaanbaatar. http://web.archive.org/web/20200404103344/https://www.forbes.com/sites/breannawilson/2020/03/16/mongolia-announces-3-new-covid-19-cases-totaling-4-how-they-got-coronavirus-precautions-right/"

The measure is intended to slow the spread of COVID-19 and requires all public activities to cease and most commercial enterprises to close, with exceptions for certain food and fuel vendors as well as health-related facilities.  But some Zimbabweans, like Edmore Hangamwe, an informal trader, says the lockdown, which will now end mid-May, will bring hunger to his home if he stops selling vegetables at a popular market in Harare.  He says lockdowns only work in the developed world.  https://web.archive.org/web/20200504132215/https://www.voanews.com/covid-19-pandemic/zimbabwe-extends-covid-lockdown-despite-pleas-workers  https://web.archive.org/web/20200504132358/https://zw.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information-2/  "

Surveillance and Laboratory Diagnosis: (1)We began to identify people who developed fever, cough or other acute respiratory symptoms and who had a past 14-day travel history or close  contact with the above mentioned people. They are all required to report to the health authorities and provide a lab specimen for further laboratory diagnosis. (2)When a person seeks medical attention using his or her National Health Insurance (NHI) card, the person’s travel history to areas affected by COVID-19 will display on the system because immigration data is linked to the National Health Insurance Administration. This system helps remind a physician to pay attention to past 14-day travel history and inquire and examine the person accordingly. This can effectively prevent failing to detect a potential case.(3)Since February 16, 2020, we have enhanced COVID-19 case finding by proactively seeking out patients with severe respiratory symptoms who had tested negative for influenza and retested them for COVID-19. In addition, patients who are highly suspected as COVID-19 infection by the physicians as well as medical staff with pneumonia or cluster are also subject to provide specimens for further laboratory diagnosis. (4)In order to have specimens tested quickly, we have improved our laboratory diagnosis capacities from 12 laboratories for 520 cases per day to 34 laboratories for 3,200 cases per day."

Taiwan citizens’ household registration system and the foreigners’ entry card allowed the government to track individuals at high risk because of recent travel history in affected areas. Those identified as high risk (under home quarantine) were monitored electronically through their mobile phones. On January 30, the NHIA database was expanded to cover the past 14-day travel history for patients from China, Hong Kong, and Macau. On February 14, the Entry Quarantine System was launched, so travelers can complete the health declaration form by scanning a QR code that leads to an online form, either prior to departure from or upon arrival at a Taiwan airport. A mobile health declaration pass was then sent via SMS to phones using a local telecom operator, which allowed for faster immigration clearance for those with minimal risk. This system was created within a 72-hour period. On February 18, the government announced that all hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies in Taiwan would have access to patients’ travel histories."
